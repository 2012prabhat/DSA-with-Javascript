Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - JavaScript
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey! üöÄ
This repository contains my daily progress, exercises, and solutions as I dive into the fascinating world of DSA using JavaScript. I'll be uploading my solutions to various DSA problems, gradually progressing from basic to advanced topics.

About Me
Hi there! üëã
I'm a developer passionate about improving my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of computer science fundamentals. Through this repository, I'm learning Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript. Every day, I aim to practice new concepts and share my learning with the community.

What to Expect
Each day, you'll find:

Problem Solving: Solutions to DSA problems, including explanations of the approach used.
Code Examples: Clear, well-commented code to demonstrate my understanding of each topic.
Progress Updates: As I advance through different topics like arrays, linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.
Challenges: Exercises to sharpen my algorithmic thinking.
Topics Covered
Here are some of the key topics that I will be exploring (and adding solutions for):

Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks & Queues
Trees & Graphs
Sorting & Searching Algorithms
Dynamic Programming
Recursion
Greedy Algorithms
Bit Manipulation
And much more...
How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore the individual solutions for each topic.
If you're learning DSA as well, this could be a great way to see how I approach different problems.
You can also fork this repository and track your own progress or contribute to solving new problems.

Example
Here's an example of a problem I solved recently:

Problem: Sum of Two Arrays
Link: Problem Link
Solution: JavaScript Code
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
Explanation: I solved this by iterating over both arrays simultaneously and adding corresponding elements to a new result array.

How to Contribute
If you have any suggestions or improvements for my solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
I'm always open to new ideas, more challenges, and constructive feedback.
Stay Updated
I'll be adding new solutions every day!
